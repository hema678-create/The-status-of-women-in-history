Creating a women's history project using CSS, JavaScript, and HTML can be a powerful way to showcase important stories and figures. Here are some ideas:

*Project Ideas:*

1. *Timeline*: Create a interactive timeline of women's history using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. *Biographies*: Build a website featuring biographies of influential women, with interactive elements and animations.
3. *Infographics*: Design interactive infographics highlighting women's achievements and milestones.
4. *Storytelling*: Create a narrative-driven website sharing stories of women's experiences and struggles.

*Example Code:*

Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you could create a simple timeline like this:
<div class="timeline">
  <div class="event" data-year="1848">
    <h2>Seneca Falls Convention</h2>
    <p>First women's rights convention in the US.</p>
  </div>
  <!-- Add more events -->
</div>

.timeline {
  position: relative;
  padding: 20px;
}

.event {
  position: relative;
  margin-bottom: 20px;
  padding: 10px;
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  border-radius: 10px;
  box-shadow: 0 0 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}

.event::before {
  content: attr(data-year);
  position: absolute;
  top: -10px;
  left: -10px;
  font-size: 18px;
  font-weight: bold;
}

*JavaScript:*
// Add interactivity, such as filtering events or animating the timeline
*Resources:*

1. Women's History Month resources
2. National Women's Hall of Fame
3. UNESCO's Women in History
